Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104
